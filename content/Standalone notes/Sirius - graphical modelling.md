# Overview

Sirius is an Eclipse project which allows you to easily create your own graphical modeling workbench by leveraging the Eclipse Modeling technologies, including EMF and GMF. It is essentially a generic workbench for model-based architecture engineering that can be easily tailored to fit specific needs.

Based on a viewpoint approach, Sirius makes it possible to equip teams who have to deal with complex architectures on specific domains.
