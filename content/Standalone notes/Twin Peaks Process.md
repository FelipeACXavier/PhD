## Feature space (Requirements)

Describes the desired properties of the system as expressed by the user. 

## Solution space (Architecture)

Contains the internal system decomposition in the form of a reference architecture composed of components. In addition, the solution space may also contain general applicable solutions that can be selected to meet certain non-functional requirements.

Michel argues that the solution space is actually the combination of the application and technical spaces, which I think is a different terminology for the “feature-solution” space in the figure above.
