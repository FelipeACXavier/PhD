# Summary

The authors perform a literature study to explore the intersection between low-code and model-driven software engineering (MBSE). They focus on analyzing the composition and growth of the emerging Low-Code community and exploring how these aspects differ from those of the “classical” model-driven community. Based on the findings, there is still very little alignment between these two fields (low-code and MBSE); thus, the authors provide a few suggestions to how they can be better connected to stimulate collaboration.

# Positive aspects

- The methodology is well-defined and the threats to the validity of the study are considered and mostly complete.
- The use of acronyms and their reiteration at certain points, make it easier for the reader to follow the paper.
- The topic is important and relevant.

# Gaps, contradictions, inconsistencies

- At some points, the paper is very superficial. Some more thought could have been put in the discussion. Will low-code suffer from the same decline as MBSE?
- What lessons can be learned from the fall of MBSE? Are we not repeating the same mistakes?
- Some figures and tables are very far from their textual references making it harder to navigate the paper.

# Comments

- A nice paper overall. I would recommend fixing the layout a bit so tables and figures are closer to their textual references before the camera-ready version.
- It might be interesting to discuss a bit the implications of the loss of interest in model-based techniques in low-code.
- "Show industry that Low-Code is a subset of modeling by creating more opportunities for showcasing Low-Code solutions in traditional Modeling venues on industry tracks, demonstration sessions, and related forums." Considering the decline in interest for modeling is that a good idea?
