# Summary

The authors explore accessibility in the Global South by evaluating 100,000 websites from 10 different countries. The paper focuses on mobile devices, as these are the most commonly used devices for internet access in the Global South. The authors highlight that countries with stricter regulations and enforcement tend to adhere better to the WCAG guidelines. However, the paper shows that there is still work needed to fully include people with disabilities, especially blind and low-vision individuals.

# Positive aspects

+ Important topic: A more generalised study on the current state of web inclusivity is essential, especially in the Global South.
+ The methodology is clearly stated what makes the study easily reproducible.
# Gaps, contradictions, inconsistencies

- There are a few mentions of the "percentage of websites," but no information is given about the number of websites from each country. Does this affect the data?
 - The discussion was rather shallow; see comments.
 - The tables and graphs are unordered, making it hard to quickly grasp which countries have higher or lower metrics. 
 - No clear mention of the threats to the validity of the study.

# Comments

I would expect some further discussion about hypotheses for these results. Does the number of people or websites affect the metrics? Is there any relation between the seen issues and the number of people with disabilities in each country?

The brief comparison with the global metric was very superb. I hoped to see more of that through the paper because, based on Figure 1, these countries seem to reflect a global trend. Is this, then, a global issue? Does it disproportionately affect countries in the Global South?

Overall, this is a pleasant paper to read. Consider reordering the table rows to reflect the number of issues or critical issues so the later comparisons are clearer to the reader. And consider extending the discussion with some threats to validity in order to show that the limitations of the study are known.
