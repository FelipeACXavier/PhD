# Progress

_What was done/accomplished this week?_

Administrative:

- Contacted:
    - Futu.re, waiting for a reply
    - TechUnited codebase: [https://gitlab.tue.nl/tech-united-eindhoven/Turtle3](https://gitlab.tue.nl/tech-united-eindhoven/Turtle3) → Mostly C and matlab
- Accepted Mauricio’s invitation to join Versen
- Joined IPA, but not the meeting in early November

Research:

- While reading related documents, I found an interesting reference architecture for robotic systems that could serve as a base for a an embedded systems architecture: [[ES Schema]]
    - Looked into how other architectures fit this reference architecture
- Started looking into the role of architecture in relation to DSLs (only today).

# Points of discussion

_What was discussed in the meeting?_

- University Teaching Qualification (UTQ) is on hold, so I would like to join: [Foundations](https://tuenl.sharepoint.com/sites/intranet-human-resources-management/SitePages//utq-module-foundations.aspx), [Teaching Skills](https://tuenl.sharepoint.com/sites/intranet-human-resources-management/SitePages/utq-module-teaching-skills.aspx), [Supervising Students](https://tuenl.sharepoint.com/sites/intranet-human-resources-management/SitePages/utq-module-supervising.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=RsPvz7&CID=860f79f0-150d-423f-8de9-205d1029dc36) and [Start to Teach](https://tuenl.sharepoint.com/sites/intranet-human-resources-management/SitePages/teaching-skills-for-phd-candidates.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=vaB58T&CID=ac33bcdd-a657-45cf-b55f-563090511306).
    - If yes, contact: Tiago Pestilla Fabbri
- What is our project number, where can I see that? I need it to order a screen.

# To-Do

_What is the plan for next week?_

- Continue exploration of architecture in DSLs
- Think about how the studied reference architecture fits the feature-solution spaces
    - Extend the schema →its components and write it down more clearly
- Check with Filip and Satrio about Benevol
- SLE → conference check
- PhD thesis Eltjo Poort
- Soft concerns
    - Deployment
- Naila, check which working group we are part of
- Keep in contact with VERUM once a month or so
