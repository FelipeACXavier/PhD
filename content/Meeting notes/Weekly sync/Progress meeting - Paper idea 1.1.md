# Progress

_What was done/accomplished this week?_

- Discussed with Ivan about visual and modelling languages
	- Making a usable language is not an easy task.
	- Converting RoboSC into a visual language, however, is not a lot of work.
- Discussed mobile robots with [[content/Meeting notes/Ad-Hoc meetings/Ad-hoc meeting - Elena Torta|Ad-hoc meeting - Elena Torta]]
	- Interested in control based optimisation frameworks
	- [Herman Bruyninckx](https://u0011821.pages.gitlab.kuleuven.be/#simple) is more into architecture of robots, so we should meet with him
	- Recommended talking to Rene again
- Filled the [[content/Administrative/Training and Supervision Plan|Training and Supervision Plan]] ([website](https://horafinita.tue.nl/promovendus/index.php?pntType=HfQuestRespons&pntHandler=EditDetailsPage&id=832&pntRef=13&pntMo=1))
- Reviewed papers for SiEGS
# Points of discussion

_What was discussed in the meeting?_

- How does the TSP look like? (How complete does it need to be? Is it fine to change the plan later?)
- Idea: Elena mentioned that lots of roboticists don't really think of an architecture, they simply start organically building the necessary software components.
	- Propose or use an existing architecture for mobile robots (see [[content/Standalone notes/ES Schema|ES Schema]]), then use and extend Stario's tools to explore the underlying architecture of several robots, and compare the expectation with reality. With this combination, we should have enough information to 
# To do

_What is the plan for next week?_

- Read the Herman's work and plan a meeting with him for January (after the 6th)
- Meet with Rene, online should be fine (we already have access to the TechUnited [gitlab](https://gitlab.tue.nl/tech-united-eindhoven/Turtle3))
- Evaluate effort necessary to extend Satrio's tool and, depending on it, start with the modifications.
- Become familiar with:
	- Software architecture recovery
	- Functional Decomposition
- If this work proposal is accepted, then start writing an actual research proposal.
- Review paper for [[content/Reviews/Review - STAF 2025 - 3|STAF 2025]]
- Look into MAPK
- gijs walhavens towards digital twins for soccer robots a use case in reusing artifacts
- Look into student TA -> programmer
- Is low-code the right paradigm?
- How would a language for each of the functionalities would look like?
- Merge capabilities with technical space through low-code.
	- UML from the existing diagram
