# Progress

_What was done/accomplished this week?_

- After a few tries, I got more familiar with Dezyne and have a better understanding of how things work under the hood. That is, the code generation and verification aspects of Dezyne. I still have no proper idea of how the verification is actually carried out and how mCRL2 code is created (maybe a refresher? Would that be useful at this stage, it seems early). See [2024-10-15, Tuesday - Starting in windows + dezyne](https://www.notion.so/2024-10-15-Tuesday-Starting-in-windows-dezyne-126457901fda802bb06ce95d51dcde82?pvs=21)
