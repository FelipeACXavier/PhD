# Progress

_What was done/accomplished this week?_

- Looked into several papers about reference architectures and _related_ languages for embedded systems
    
    - Interesting papers are marked in [[Exploration of reference architectures and related languages]]
    - A team possibly working on a similar research: [Antonio et al. 2012](https://www.zotero.org/felipeacxavier/items/S4KQX35K/attachment/YR6QXNNE/reader). However, I could not find anything else regarding this topic from the authors. Would be interesting to contact them?

> The results of this mapping are being used in the context of a project that is under development by this research group, whose main objective is to define a development process for embedded systems. This process should involve requirements elicitation and their modelling, aiming at supporting the construction of lower level models, such as Simulink models.

# Points of discussion

_What was discussed in the meeting?_

- Discuss the meeting time next week →Loek and Michel mismatch.
    - Moved to Friday the 1st
- David connected me and Mauricio to talk about Versen ([https://www.versen.nl](https://www.versen.nl/)). Worth it?
    - Yes
- Saturation →
- Create a schema and new papers should (most likely) fit the schema if it is really saturated.
- Rigor vs relevance → Michel favors relevance
    - Might be nice to also present results to other researchers and get feedback.

# To-Do

_What is the plan for next week?_

- Try to have a look into papers that cite the found papers
- Create schema with current papers
- Check papers that cite found papers
    - “Cited by” or “related to”
- Look through a few other papers to check how they match the schema
    - Builds more confidence
- Start looking into “What is the role of architectures in relation to DSL’s?”
- Check [fut.re](http://fut.re) software (contact them if no info is available online), first choice instead of TechUnited for evaluation.
    - Through Verum might be better.
