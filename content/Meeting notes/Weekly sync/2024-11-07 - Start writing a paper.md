# Progress

_What was done/accomplished this week?_

Administrative:

- Futu-re saw my message but are not ready to commit to anything. Rutger mentioned that Verum is still trying to bring them on board, the deal is not done.

General:

- Looked into DSL and architecture papers.
- Interesting papers:
    - [Dalibor et al. 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590118422000235) (shared by Michel): Development of digital twins through a common architecture and LCDP
    - [Miyazawa et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10270-018-00710-z): Modelling and verification of robotic applications. Found through [Shaukat et al. 2024](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10704818)
    - A proposed process for the design of DSLs, but quite old: [Mernik et al. 2005](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1118890.1118892)

# Points of discussion

_What was discussed in the meeting?_

- Aachem university MontiCore framework:
    - [https://monticore.github.io/monticore/](https://monticore.github.io/monticore/)
    - [https://monticore.de/download/handbook.pdf/](https://monticore.de/download/handbook.pdf/)
    - Do we know any of the people involved?  
        - Bernhard Rumpe  
        - Katrin Hölldobler  
        - Oliver Kautz  
        It seem quite nice and it is used by  
        [Dalibor et al. 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590118422000235) to generate low-code development platforms for digital twins. I found its workflow to be very similar to MetaEdit+ (MetaCase)
- Similar question in relation to: [Miyazawa et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10270-018-00710-z)
    - RoboChart seems relatively close to what Verum is trying to achieve.
- Work package structure [[Felipe’s Journal/Administrative/Administrative|Administrative]]

# To-Do

_What is the plan for next week?_

- Continue looking into DSL architecture and low-code applications.
    - Have a deeper look into RoboChart and Monticore.
- Look further into low-code approaches
    - Start to connect the studied DSL architectures with low-code approaches
- Talk to Verum about the hours and check AVL
- Check budget → Loek will send an email and I will follow up from there
- Talk to Tim
    - Also check the FSA candidate
- Start putting into words what we want to achieve from this. Basically, what the end goal is with these information we keep finding. → paper-like form
- Have a look into discussed books.
