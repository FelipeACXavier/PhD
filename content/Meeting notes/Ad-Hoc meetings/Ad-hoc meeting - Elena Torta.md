# Goals / agenda

- Ivan mentioned that a visual/low-code approach was not thought at the time regarding RoboSC. Nonetheless, is there any merit to this idea?
- What are the most difficult steps when developing autonomous robots?
- What steps do students for example have more trouble with? Deployment, packaging, behaviour definition, controller, etc...
- Which ones could be benefited from a more visually oriented approach?
- What would you like to see in such an approach to say it is actually useful?
