# Goals / agenda

- I think it would be nice to join ICSA 2025. The following workshops look very relevant:
	- [AEDT](https://conf.researchr.org/info/icsa-2025/AEDT)
	- [LArc](https://conf.researchr.org/info/icsa-2025/LArc)
	- [MDE4SA](https://conf.researchr.org/info/icsa-2025/MDE4SA)
	- [SARECS](https://conf.researchr.org/info/icsa-2025/SARECS)
- The deadline was moved to January 4th which means that there is some time to write a short during the holidays.
- I don't have anything tangible that makes me confident to submit.
- What would a vision/roadmap paper look like?
- How does one go about getting in touch with the organizers in order to volunteer to co-organize next year?

# Discussion notes

- What needs to be researched in order to achieve this? (low-code platform for embedded systems)
